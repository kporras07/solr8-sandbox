Test examples for Remote Error Monitor
======================================

So far, the only ones that should not log anything are:
- phpinfo.php
- exception-caught.php

All of the other exampels should throw something into Remote Error Monitor.

To add new examples:
- Add a new file
- Make sure the second line is a comment with the example name.
- Voil√†!
